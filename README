This folder contains a customization pack for Lubuntu.

The idea is that everything is contained here instead of sprinkled throughout
the system. Links are created in the appropriate places pointing to these files
by the script setup.sh.

Two main features are contained in this currently.
1. WMII custom session: This is a Xsession setup with wmii and using lxsession
and lxpanel from LXDE. The lxpanel has a tweaked theme.
2. scripts run when lid is opened and closed. This will be used to set the
screens correctly.

The customizations use wmii acpi and acpid.
To install the needed packages: ./setup.sh packages
To install the customizations: ./setup.sh install
To remove the customizations: ./setup.sh uninstall
